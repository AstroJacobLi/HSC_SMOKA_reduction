# HSC_SMOKA_reduction
Scripts for reducing HSC data using the latest LSST Science Pipelines

One can use the functions in [`commands.py`](https://github.com/AstroJacobLi/HSC_SMOKA_reduction/blob/main/commands.py) to generate commands to ingest data, reduce calibration data, and reduce the science data. Note that these commands only work on very recent LSST stack (tested on `w_2025_04`).
